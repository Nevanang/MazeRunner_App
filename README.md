# MazeRunner_App
Using Algorithms to Solve Mazes
Scenario: A startup company delivering pizzas wants to navigate their drones with optimal efficiency in a city map, made up of:

X:  Building (drone canâ€™t go here)
.:  Road ( drone can fly here)
s:  The start location of the drone
e: The pizza delivery location

Create a Maze-Running App that can find possible ways to traverse a city to a specified destination
Includes:

Map,
Input Map file,
Algorithm Selector
